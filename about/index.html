  <h3>Sophia Jang</h3>
  <p class="position">
    <i>Vice President, Class of 2024</i>
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/images/people/sophia-jang.png" alt="Sophia Jang">
  <p>Sophia is a third-year from Syosset, NY, majoring in Global Public Health and Biology. Her favorite SciOly event is Microbe Mission (where are our biology nerds at?). Her favorite SciOly moments were probably at the first invitational and EXTREMELY chaotic last state tournament in 2019. Special shout-out to the stuffed animals along the way.</p>

  <h3>Alvin Meng</h3>
  <p class="position">
    <i>Secretary, Class of 2025</i>
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/images/people/alvin-meng.jpg" alt="Alvin Meng">
  <p>Alvin Meng is a second-year from Vienna, VA, majoring in Chemistry and Mathematics. Among his favorite events are Astronomy, Dynamic Planet (but only tectonics!), and Chemistry Lab, though a part of him wishes that he did more build events. His greatest SciOly memories must be from those trips he went on with his team, not the least of which is The Soup Saga (which is much too long for this little blurb &ndash; and no, it&rsquo;s not related to the invitational).</p>

  <h3>Medha Prakash</h3>
  <p class="position">
    <i>Outreach Officer, Class of 2023</i>
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/images/people/medha-prakash.png" alt="Medha Prakash">
  <p>Medha is a fourth-year from Portland, OR, majoring in Environmental Science and Statistics with a minor in Astronomy. She is an absolute rock nerd &ndash; no wonder her favorite event was Rocks and Minerals! Her favorite memory from SciOly was during Nationals in 2019, when she and her teammates stayed up all night playing sardines, doing karaoke, and playing truth or dare.</p>

  <h3>Diana Park</h3>
  <p class="position">
    <i>Graphics Designer, Class of 2025</i>
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/images/people/diana-park.png" alt="Diana Park">
  <p>Diana is a second-year from Herndon, VA, intending to major in either Biology or Biochemistry. Her favorite SciOly event is Ornithology, and she&rsquo;s got the track record to back it up. (Ask her about the time she placed at Regionals despite feeling absolutely clueless!)</p>

  <h3>Shreyas Mayya</h3>
  <p class="position">
    <i>Technology Specialist, Class of 2026</i>
  </p>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/images/people/shreyas-mayya.jpg" alt="Shreyas Mayya">
  <p>Shreyas is a first-year from Lorton, VA, intending to major in Computer Science. Favorite SciOly events of his include Codebusters, Sounds of Music, and Thermodynamics (yay physics events!) His favorite SciOly memories have to be all the Mafia games he played with his high school team and the hilarity that ensued.</p>
