## Cancellation Notice

Good evening all,

The SOUVA team is shocked and immensely saddened by the tragedy that struck UVA last evening. There are no words that suffice to describe our emotions, and we are sure that many others feel the same way.

First and foremost, we urge you to take care of yourself as we process our grief in our own ways.

To the victims of yesterday’s events, their friends, and their families, we send our most sincere condolences. We will keep you in our thoughts.

To the University and Charlottesville communities at large, SOUVA stands with you against acts of violence.

In light of these events, we feel that we can no longer move forward with our Science Olympiad invitational tournament scheduled for Saturday, November 19th. **Therefore, we are officially canceling the 2022 Science Olympiad at UVA Invitational.**

To our volunteers, we extend our deepest gratitude for your time and effort toward making the first SOUVA Invitational reality. We could not have achieved what we have thus far without your support.

To participating coaches and teams: We are sure that you have worked hard in preparation and regret that we can no longer provide this opportunity for you to compete. We understand that this news might be met with disappointment, but we must also be mindful of the burdens that these events have placed on our community, including many of our volunteers, coaches, and students. To that end, we will be issuing full refunds to all registered teams; coaches can expect to receive an email containing logistics information in the near future. Furthermore, in due time, we will publicly release the exam materials that have been completed as of this writing.

We urge you to stay safe and seek out the support you need at this challenging moment. As the initial shock of the events pass, we grieve together. In time, we will heal. We hope to see you next year.

In solidarity and memory of those who were unjustly taken away from us,

SOUVA Executive Board and Staff

November 14, 2022

Ryan is a first-year from Springfield, VA, intending to major in Mechanical Engineering. His favorite SciOly event has to be Write It Do It -- he loves how complicated it can be to describe something perfectly. Highlights from his SciOly career include grinding cryptograms during online class and testing Wright Stuff planes every morning before sunrise.

Krishna is a first-year from Falls Church, VA, intending to major in Biochemistry and Neuroscience on the pre-health track. Protein Modeling's combination of conceptual knowledge with technology and building made it his favorite event, but he's also fond of Disease Detectives and Anatomy and Physiology. Krishna vividly remembers exploring (and getting lost on) Grounds with his friends as a freshman, and likes to think that everything has finally come full circle.

Pranav is a second-year from Chantilly, VA, who is currently undecided about his major. His favorite events include Machines and Sounds of Music, because you get both a test and a device -- it's the best of both worlds! He fondly remembers staying up late before competitions with his partners to make sure everything was working.
